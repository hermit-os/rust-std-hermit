# rust-std-hermit

This repository provides installable distribution artifacts of `rust-std` for the `hermit` targets.

## Requirements

* [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Usage

1.  Download the artifact from the latest [release].

    [release]: https://github.com/hermitcore/rust-std-hermit/releases

2.  Extract the archive, navigate in bash to the extracted folder and run `./install.sh`

    The install script will install the `rust-std-hermit` component to the corresponding rustup toolchain.

3.  You can now build Rust applications with the corresponding toolchain for the installed `hermit` target without using `build-std`.
